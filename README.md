# TCP-IP-Packet-Sniffer
A packet sniffer allows the user to view and capture all the information that is transmitted over the network, as packets of data. 

The aim of this application is to read packets that travel across various layers of the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model of network architecture. The packet sniffer, or the network traffic monitoring framework will analyze the network traffic so as to allow users to get a practical understanding of the flow of packets in a network. It will help them gain some insights on the header structures of different protocols, differences between the protocols at different network layers, similarities between the protocols on the same network layer and change in size of the payload as the packet travels through the network stack. 

It will be used to capture and analyze the following protocolsâ€™ header information from the packets:

Application Layer: HTTP, DNS
Transport Layer: TCP, UDP
Network Layer: IPv4, Ipv6
Data Link Layer: ARP

The packets captured will be analyzed to extract and display the header information along with other relevant parameters for the selected protocols.
